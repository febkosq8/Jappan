## Reason for this repository

- This is not supposed to be a definitive guide on how to build a discord bot.

- The `.env` and `config.json` files are not provided by design, to discourage people to not use this as a clone and use bot repo.

- This repository is to showcase the ways to implement various commands/packages (discord.js, discord-player, etc).

- Most of the implementation should be fairly simple to understand. Feel free to drop me a DM on Discord : Febkosq8#8685, to clarify doubt's.

_Actual development work happens over at another private repo._
